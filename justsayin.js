//module.exports is an object so advice has to be an object or constructor?



var campaignTweets = ["hey there! ", "what's up? ", "what's the word? ", "come back ", "you got this "]; //this is an object


// for (var i = 0; i < campaignTweets.length; i++){
// 	return campaignTweets[i];
// }

module.exports = campaignTweets;
