//All of this makes me wonder if anyone actually read the interview, because he talks about (and complicates) the very thing that others so boringly mock him for: his vanity.

//What I am interested in talking about, and what I think is often overlooked, is how race affects the way people perceive and respond to his vanity.

//Kanye is a part of a long tradition of black artists for whom self-love is a political act.

//The concept of vanity is so rooted in the idea of a singular narcissist that it can be hard to catch that Kanye speaks almost from a populist perspective — a populist narcissism, if you will.

//If you chalk up his “we don’t care what people say” attitude to simply his ego, then you have missed the point entirely.

//This isn’t about ego; this is about boldly asserting yourself in a world that is not meant for you.

//the message he gives the kids (in front of all these white folks who are listening to his music!) is not to be modest but to unapologetically laugh in the face of a world that does not care about them.

//This is why it’s so critical to really think about how and why folks are calling him “crazy.”

//To continuously label what Kanye says as “crazy” is to dismiss him as not worth understanding and to flatten his deeply complex work and complex personality.

//...laughing to keep from cryiing...encapsulates a history of black artists who have used wit and satire to capture their exasperations and make light of the world’s absurdities.

//To assert that, despite the boundaries of a racist world that strangles your very view of what is possible, you are still going to be out here stuntin’ on everyone, that you will love yourself and love yourself excessively, is powerful beyond measure.

//for black folks to love themselves is a political act.

//Kanye’s “vanity” is meant to be inspiring; it is not a mindless arrogance but it is pointed and intentional.

//“I’m going to use my platform to tell people that they’re not being fair… Justice. And when you say justice, it doesn’t have to be war. Justice could just be clearing a path for people to dream properly.”

//black artists have used art and fashion to re-imagine the possibilities of what it means to be black, of what is possible and imaginable for black identities.

//..this balance between the political and the beautiful has been characteristic of his discography. 

//Conversations that take Kanye’s vanity as a given annoyance obfuscate the fact that Kanye has helped change the game entirely for how black men are allowed to express their vulnerabilities in public.

//If you see him simply as a crazy egomaniac, you’ve taken away his right to be a dimensional human being.

//You miss the moments when he is so boldly asserting his vulnerabilities, his anxieties, his humanity — the times he is placing his bare self on the line as an artist.

//This bravado mixed with a deeply sincere self-reflectiveness has characterized his career from the very beginning.

//It’s hard to imagine the sappy crooning of Drake or the angsty emo rap of Kid Cudi existing if it weren’t for Kanye.

// ???? MAYBE NOT THIS ONE//
//He’s keenly aware of the way black identity, and black masculinity in particular, is wedded to an image, a static image, and he purposefully plays with that.

//...ultimately, I am grateful for the space that his bold and unapologetically vain work has created for black artists, for black children, for dreamers

//how much pride is allowed for one person? At what point does being proud of yourself turn into being “too vain”? Who decides?
